OVERVIEW

## Climate Impact
The article ["Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning"] (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3485128). highlights how AI can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions by improving electricity systems. In a nutshell:
- Electricity generation is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions.
- Reducing emissions requires a shift to low-carbon energy sources and increased system flexibility to meet demand without relying on fossil-fuel backup.
    ### ML Role
    - Improved Forecasting: ML can better predict energy needs, allowing system operators to reduce reliance on polluting backup plants.
    - Accurate ML forecasts guide where and when to build renewable plants for maximum efficiency.

Reading the article 'Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning' it is notourious that AI can have a big impact in the
fight of climate changes. According to the article AI can adress the problems with Electricity Systems.
In a nutshell:
    . Electricty is one of the main causes for greenhourse gas emissions (generation and storage of electricity, delivery of electricity to end-use consumers)
    . There's an urgency to reduce emissions from electricity systems by:
        - Transition to low-carbon electricity sources
        - Inflexibility of energy system (each time energy created needs = energy consumed - few flexibility, no storage)
        - ML can be used to predict better forecasters ( is good to predict energy we are going to have) - can allow
system operators to reduce their reliance on polluting standby plants and to proactively manage increasing
amounts of variable sources. Better long-term forecasts can help system operators (and investors) determine
where and when variable plants should be built
